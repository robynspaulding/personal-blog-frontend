## General info
This project is a simple blog web app that allows users to Signup, Login, Create, Edit and Delete a Post (while logged in) and Logout through accessing the Rails secure authentication in the backend/api. In the future I'd like to add a comments section and like button. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React.js - This Repo
* <a href="https://github.com/robynspaulding/personal-blog-api"> Ruby on Rails Backend API Repo</a>
* Bootstrap styling resources

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robynspaulding/personal-blog-frontend.git
